## 8. Postman Collection

## 9. Quick Test Commands

### One-liner to test full workflow:

```bash
# Set these first
export API_BASE="http://localhost:3000/api"
export MANAGER_TOKEN="your-manager-token"
export TEACHER_ID="your-teacher-id"
export STUDENT_ID="your-student-id"

# Then run this complete test
echo "Creating class..." && \
curl -s -X POST $API_BASE/classes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Class","teacher":"'$TEACHER_ID'","capacity":30}' | jq '.data.class._id' && \
echo "âœ… Setup complete!"
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Backend not responding?

```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check backend logs
# (in your backend terminal)
```

### Invalid token errors?

```bash
# Re-login to get fresh token
curl -X POST $API_BASE/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"manager@school.com","password":"manager123"}'
```

### CORS errors?

The backend should have CORS enabled. If testing from browser/Flutter app, ensure CORS middleware is configured in the backend.

## Next Steps

After verifying API works with curl:

1. âœ… Test all auth endpoints
2. âœ… Create manager, teacher, receptionist accounts
3. âœ… Create students and classes
4. âœ… Test notification workflow
5. ðŸ”„ Integrate Flutter app with API
6. ðŸ”„ Add Socket.IO for real-time updates

**Ready to integrate with Flutter app!** ðŸš€
